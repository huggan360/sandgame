# Tropical Sips: Party Island

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to host a quick drinking game night. The experience now uses modular scripts so each minigame can evolve on its own. Spin up a party from the lobby to invite between two and four phones as controllers—share the link shown in the lobby, wait for everyone to ready up, then start the round from the host screen.

## Controls
- **Player 1:** WASD to move, Space to interact/shoot
- **Player 2:** Arrow keys to move, Enter/Numpad Enter to interact/shoot

## Minigames
- **Tiki Brawl:** Shoot between crates; 3 hits to win.
- **Pineapple Rush:** Race to 5 points; golden pineapples grant 3 points.
- **Flappy Flock:** Tap to keep your colorful bird in the air and slip through palm pipes.
- **Boardwalk Dash:** Move left and right down the lane to dodge incoming crates.
- **Crab Dodge:** Avoid the sideways stampede of crabs—one pinch knocks you out.

The wheel decides the mode, a quick intro counts down, and the loser follows the sip rule shown after each round.
