# Tropical Sips: Party Island

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to host a quick two-player drinking game night. The experience now uses modular scripts so each minigame can evolve on its own.

## Controls
- **Player 1:** WASD to move, Space to interact/shoot
- **Player 2:** Arrow keys to move, Enter/Numpad Enter to interact/shoot

## Minigames
- **Tiki Brawl:** Shoot between crates; 3 hits to win.
- **Coconut Chaos:** Avoid falling coconuts that speed up over time.
- **Pineapple Rush:** Race to 5 points; golden pineapples grant 3 points.

The wheel decides the mode, a quick intro counts down, and the loser follows the sip rule shown after each round.
